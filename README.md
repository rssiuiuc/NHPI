# NHPI

**Normalized Harvest Phenology Index (NHPI)** is a remote sensing–based spectral index designed to estimate harvesting dates of corn and soybean using Google Earth Engine (GEE). This repository provides tools to apply NHPI for harvesting date detection based on user-defined analysis needs.

## 🌐 Interactive Demo

Try the NHPI demo here:  
👉 [https://ee-cuglyfrank.projects.earthengine.app/view/nhpi-demo](https://ee-cuglyfrank.projects.earthengine.app/view/nhpi-demo)

The interactive tool allows users to:
- Click on the map to sample a field
- Visualize the time series of NHPI, NDVI, and detected harvest date
- Adjust the NHPI threshold to examine its effect on harvesting date detection

## 📂 Repository Contents

- 🟩 **Interactive GEE Demo**  
  Hosted app for exploring NHPI-based harvesting date estimates (see link above).

- 🟨 **Google Earth Engine JavaScript Code**  
  Full source code used in the analysis and visualization.  
  *(Will be publicly available upon formal publication.)*

- 🐍 **Jupyter Notebook (GEE Python API)**  
  Code to reproduce large-scale harvesting date estimation using the GEE Python API.  
  *(Will be made public upon publication.)*

## 📢 Note

The interactive GEE demo is currently accessible. The complete source code (JavaScript and Python) will be released after the formal publication of the associated paper.
