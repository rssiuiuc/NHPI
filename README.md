# Normalized Harvest Phenology Index (NHPI)

**Normalized Harvest Phenology Index (NHPI)** is a remote sensing–based spectral index designed to estimate harvesting dates of corn and soybean using Google Earth Engine (GEE). This repository provides tools to apply NHPI for harvesting date detection based on user-defined analysis needs.

## 🌐 Interactive Demo

Try the NHPI demo here:

The interactive tool allows users to:
<ul>
  <li>Click on the map to sample a field</li>
  <li>Visualize the time series of NHPI, NDVI, and detected harvest date</li>
  <li>Adjust the NHPI threshold to examine its effect on harvesting date detection</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Each step may take time to process. Please wait for the result to appear before clicking again.</p>
